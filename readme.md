# Fingerprint Authentication System

A lightweight and secure fingerprint-based authentication system using cryptographic challenges to validate user identity.

## Features

- **Biometric Authentication**: Verifies users using fingerprint-based cryptographic signatures.
- **Challenge-Response Protocol**: Ensures data integrity and prevents replay attacks.
- **No Template Storage**: Fingerprint templates are not stored, enhancing privacy.

## How It Works

1. **Signup**: The client generates a public-private key pair and sends the public key to the server during the signup process.
2. **Challenge Generation**: The server issues a unique challenge to the client for authentication.
3. **Signature Creation**: The client signs the challenge using the private key.
4. **Verification**: The server validates the signature against the stored public key.

## Frontend Integration Steps

1. **Generate Key Pair**:
   - Use a cryptographic library to generate a public-private key pair on the client device.
   - Send the public key to the server during the signup process.

2. **Store Private Key**:
   - Securely store the private key on the client device (e.g., using secure storage APIs).

3. **Request Authentication**:
   - Trigger a request to the server for a challenge.

4. **Sign Challenge**:
   - Use the private key to sign the received challenge.
   - Send the signature back to the server for verification.

5. **Handle Response**:
   - Receive authentication success or failure response from the server.

## Server Validation

1. Verify the signature using the stored public key.
2. Ensure the challenge is unique and not reused.
3. Respond with appropriate authentication status.

## Security Notes

- **Private Key Security**: The private key must never leave the client device.
- **Challenge Expiry**: Challenges should have a short lifespan to prevent misuse.
- **HTTPS**: Always use secure connections to protect data in transit.
